This definition relates \"career\" to a range of aspects of an individual's life, learning, and work. \"Career\" is also frequently understood[by whom?] to relate to the working aspects of an individual's life - as in \"career woman\", for example. A third way in which the term \"career\" is used describes an occupation or a profession that usually involves special training or formal education,;[1] considered[by whom?] to be a person's lifework.[2][failed verification] In this case \"a career\" is seen[by whom?] as a sequence of related jobs, usually pursued within a single industry or sector: one can speak for example of \"a career in education\", of \"a criminal career\" or of \"a career in the building trade\". A career has been defined by organizational behavior researchers as \"an individual's work-related and other relevant experiences, both inside and outside of organizations, that form a unique pattern over the individual's life span.\" [3]\r\nEtymology\r\n\r\nThe word \"career\" ultimately derives from Latin carrus, referring to a chariot.[4] The semantic extension whereby \"career\" came to mean \"course of one's public or professional life\" appears from 1803.[5] "], ["created_at", "2021-02-28 13:44:03.041635"], ["updated_at", "2021-02-28 13:44:03.041635"], ["user_id", 2], ["channel_id", 4], ["slug", "how-to-find-a-job-in-one-day"]]

So, when the mouse cursor moves to the right side of the screen, the value of the --positionX will be higher; and when it moves to left, it gets lower. We’ll do the same with --positionY: the value will be lower as the cursor moves to the top, and higher when it moves to the bottom.\r\n\r\nA few words about the grid size we’re using: We can actually make the grid whatever size we want. The larger it is, the more accurate our custom property values will be. But that also means we will have more cells, which can lead to performance issues. It’s important to maintain proper balance and adjust the grid size to the specific needs of each project.\r\n\r\nFor now, lets say that we want a 10×10 grid for a total of 100 cells in our markup. (And yes, it’s OK to use Pug for that, even though I won’t in this example.)\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"cell\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"cell\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"cell\"></div>\r\n<!-- 97 more cells -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"content\">\r\n  <div class=\"square\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n``` ", "channel_id"=>""}, "commit"=>"Create Post"}
